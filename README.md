**Description**

Working in multiple repositories at a time becomes really confusing. VS Code hiding the repository name when the explorer tab is collapsed, doesn't help either ðŸ¤¦. `Which` is a simple extension that solves this problem by constantly showing the repository (workspace) name in the status bar.

**Installation**

The extenstion has not been published on the VSCode Marketplace yet. You can however download the `vsix` file for the latest [release](https://github.com/ahsan/which/releases) and install it manually in your VS Code.
